# Open Procure
## Welcome!

Open Procure is an **online open data repository of government purchasing information across the United States**.

Our goal is to make municipal, county-level, state and federal purchasing easily accessible for everyone. It is where government officials, technologists, and active citizens can work together to make our purchasing processes more transparent.

See it live at http://openprocure.us/

### How to search for procurement thresholds

Procurement thresholds are not easily accessible through government websites. Here are some tips on finding them.

*To be written*

### Adding data to Open Procure

[Edit `data/procurement.yaml` directly on GitHub][edit data].  When you submit your changes, GitHub will automatically create a pull request. After the team merges it, the live website will be updated automatically.  It takes about 1 min and you need to refresh your browser, but it is really that simple.  No further action required.

Always include a link to source of the procurement thresholds you are adding to make future verification easy.

#### When adding a PDF as a link

Make sure you append the page number at the end.  If I wanted to add a link to **page 2** of [this PDF](http://www.publishers.org.uk/_resources/assets/attachment/full/0/2091.pdf), I would add a `#page=2` at the end of the URL. e.g. `http://www.publishers.org.uk/_resources/assets/attachment/full/0/2091.pdf#page=2`

## Development

The website is hosted on GitHub pages.  The static HTML pages are in the gh-pages branch.

The website is generated using the Middleman tool. The Middleman template is in the master branch.
